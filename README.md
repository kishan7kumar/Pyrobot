# Pyrobot - Autonomous Fire Detection & Control System

## Brief Description

The detection and prevention of ﬁre is a significant problem nowadays. Detection of ﬁre in its initial stages is critical as it reduces the risk of its spreading and the harmful impact on humans. Because of the inadequacy of conventional ﬁre detection techniques like a smoke alarm, we have introduced a system that can detect and suppress fire. The small-scale Fire Detection & Control System designed here is assumed to be deployed within a ﬂoor of the building having several rooms. A single room is chosen here to demonstrate the working of the system. This room is equipped with a camera system, which detects ﬁre using Keras deep learning model deployed in Raspberry Pi 3. It is also equipped with an infrared light sensor to detect infrared waves coming from ﬁre to increase accuracy. After detecting ﬁre, it alerts the robot parked in the central room using a wireless communication protocol(TCP). The robot uses eight array high-resolution line follower sensor to ﬁnd out the fastest route to the room. Moreover, if one path is blocked, it is capable of ﬁnding another possible route. After reaching the room, the robot locates the fire using the camera system attached to its front. It then uses a class ABC ﬁre extinguisher installed inside it to put out the ﬁre. Apart from this autonomous operation of the system, a manual operation is also available using the android application. The robot can also be controlled with an android app to navigate inside the ﬂoor and search for the ﬁre. As we know, fire can cause damage to property, danger to human life, etc., so it's necessary to stop before it can cause any massive destruction. The conventional techniques used in today's scenario are smoke alarms which are sometimes not eﬀective in detecting ﬁre. The Fire Fighting System developed here can detect fire early using a powerful Deep Learning model. This system can be used in ﬁre situations at malls, residential buildings, oﬃces where human ﬁre-ﬁghter face diﬃculties to go.
